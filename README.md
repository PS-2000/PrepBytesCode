# How to start preparation for placements?
To start with first and foremost , finalize your target companies.

Talk to seniors placed in your target companies before starting the preparation for a particular target company.

Prioritize the list of target companies based on your interests and goals

Make a schedule for yourself.

Make a monthly preparation goal to achieve.

Divide it into weekly and further bifurcate it to daily. Set real time daily targets for yourself.# Remember: Rome was not built in a day 99% of the companies ask for Resume for shortlisting. Make a rough draft of your resume & take feedback from seniors & experts and then freeze it

There are some topics which are commonly asked by every other company. Prepare them first.

Do not try and go beyond your syllabus (until your research shows that the company asks something beyond syllabus). Companies do not ask anything beyond the basics of what you have learnt in your academia

Make an exhaustive list of all the questions which were asked by the companies in past 2 years.

Practice is very important and should be done on a daily basis. Prepare a list of similar questions & topics which can be asked and get a nice grip around such topics

More you practice, more confident you get before the actual test

Prepare taking Mock interviews for yourself in a complete professional set up and work the feedbacks gathered

Focus on your soft skills in case you lack. It helps to boost your confidence and explain things in a better way during placement interviews
Nothing can stop you if you plan well and execute it keeping time & focus into consideration
